# Python Link Spider
### Made as a standalone module of my NEA project in order to simulate an SEO search engine crawler.

To use, enter the url such as https://google.com with the --url flag and the depth you would like to achieve with the --depth flag.

Example would be python3 main.py --url https://google.com --depth 2
